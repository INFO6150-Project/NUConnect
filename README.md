# NUConnect

## Project Description

NUConnect is a platform designed for developers to connect and collaborate. It allows users to engage in live video calls, join chat rooms, and share their expertise and ideas. The website fosters real-time collaboration among developers, making it easier to communicate, learn, and grow together.

The platform is responsive and optimized for all devices, providing a seamless user experience whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

## Purpose

The purpose of NUConnect is to provide developers with a space to:
- **Connect with peers**: Engage with fellow developers in live video calls.
- **Join chat rooms**: Discuss topics, share resources, and collaborate in real time.
- **Network and grow**: Build professional connections, learn new skills, and contribute to developer communities.

## Pages Created

1. **Home Page**: The landing page of the platform that introduces users to NUConnect and its features.
2. **About Page**: Provides information about the platform's purpose and goals.
3. **Login Page**: Allows registered users to log in to the platform.
4. **Signup Page**: Allows new users to register and create accounts.
5. **Forgot Password Page**: Helps users recover their accounts in case they forget their password.
6. **Contact Page**: Contains a form for users to reach out for support or inquiries.
7. **Admin Page**: Restricted to administrators for managing user data and platform settings.

## Validation

The login page includes field validation similar to Assignment 3:
- **Email validation**: Ensures that users provide a valid email format.
- **Password validation**: Ensures that passwords meet security criteria (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of special characters).
